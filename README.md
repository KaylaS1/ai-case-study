How lovely it would be to have AI do this tedious work for me! This case study is an exploration of the video creation industry and one of its top company **Synthesia**.

## Origin and Funding

**Synthesia.io** calls itself an AI video communications platform.  It was founded in 2017 by Victor Riparbelli, Steffen Tjerrild, Prof. Matt Niessner and Prof. Lourdes Agapito - a team of AI researchers and entrepreneurs from UCL, Stanford, TUM and Cambridge. The founders wanted to "to empower everyone to make video content - without cameras, microphones, or studios".  Using AI, Synthesia aims to "radically change the process of content creation and unleash human creativity for good".

As part of a Series C funding round in June 2023, Synthesia raised an additional $90 million from US fund Accel and Nvidia among others, granting the company **a total valuation of $1 billion!**

## Business Activities

### Market Drivers - Expanding Social Media Influence and Video Marketing

Straits Research says that the growing dominance of social media platforms has dramatically boosted demand for video-producing tools. Visual content, particularly videos, is prioritized on social media channels because it has a higher engagement and shareability rate than other media types. TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook all prioritize video content, pushing users and companies to make visually beautiful and entertaining videos. Short-form videos, in particular, have grown in popularity, necessitating the development of video creation tools that allow users to create content specifically designed for these platforms.

Video marketing is currently booming across several industries and is expectded to continue to grow. Videos are now the preferred choice of most businesses as they are a more cost-effective marketing medium than traditional methods such as print, social media, or email. Videos are more engaging and can convey information more effectively than text or static images. They are also more likely to be shared on social media, leading to wider reach and increased visibility. Additionally, the cost of producing high-quality videos has decreased significantly in recent years with AI and Generative AI. A blog on StoryXpress states that the top 7 industries that use video to signficant advantage are
* Real Estate
* Finance
* Healthcare
* Education
* eCommerce
* Travel and Hospitality
* Restaurants and Bars

### Market Constraints - High Competition and Fragmentation

According to Straits Research, the video creation tool industry has many vendors offering similar features. As of February 2024, the Google Play Store offered 3.718 million apps for Android users. Competition is high with an abundance of online video content creation tools catering to various consumer wants and preferences.

The market is also fragmented, with several tools catering to specific niches, such as professional video editing, social media content generation, and user-friendly templates for novices. This fragmentation makes it difficult for consumers to find and select the tool that best meets their needs. It might also cause user confusion and hinder market consolidation.  As a result, new entrants face significant challenges in obtaining market share due to existing firms' dominance and the necessity for substantial marketing efforts to break through the clutter.

## Results

* Synthesia does not disclose its sales or revenue metrics, but it has stated that its number of users have grown 465% year over year, that over 12 million videos have been created on its platform and that Synthesia works with 47% of Fortune 100 companies.

* Zapier has rated Synthesia as the best AI video editing software for using digital avatars.

## Recommendations

* <b>Add more avatars in the Mature age range.</b>  At the time of this writing, Synthesia only has 11 Mature avatars, but has over 150 avatars in the Young and Middle age ranges. Increasing avatar diversity in age ranges would make Synthesia seem more inclusive. Best of all, no additional technologies would be needed to make this improvement, just add a few more AI-generated avatar pictures.
